## Helping the President Appeal to Americans in the State of the Union Address

## Prompt
The President of the United States is approaching their State of the Union (SOTU) address in which they will speak directly to the public about the state of the country, the progress they’ve made, and their policy priorities for the upcoming year. This address is especially important because it is the President’s last SOTU before they run for reelection and they want to construct a favorable image so the American people will support them in their reelection campaign. You are one of the President’s advisors and they ask you to make some recommendations for topics or policies they should emphasize in their speech that will appeal to the American public. To be sure your recommendations will be useful, the President asks you to use data science to analyze what topics Presidents have referenced the most in their SOTU addresses throughout history. This will inform the President what policies and programming most appeals to Americans to give them the best chance of improving their approval rating going into their reelection campaign.

## Deliverable
